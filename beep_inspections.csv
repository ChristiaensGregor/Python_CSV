Replace the top brood box's filler frame with foundation, put it two frames from the right, seeing as the queen was a bit more active in that region

And lowered the filler frames from 4 to 2. Now there is a one filler frame on the right of each brood box"
2306;145587;2022-04-27 20:24:51;21313;Gele kast;4183;8-);No;;;Active inside but not aggressive, added a box, 4 filler frames (one on each side), pulled up 2 frames (one with queen) and filled the rest with spare frames from dead hive. Queen excluder between them (with the 2nd entrance)

- queen is at the bottom. So is most of the brood 
- top has lots of honey frames.
- bottom was way busier than the top
- drone brood low
- very slow building
- still one filler frame left top
- drone frame haven't built much.

1 box strategy require probably"

- bottom: good amount of brood in middle.
Some pollen as well.
- removed 1/3 drone frame"

Same as yellow, top honey, bottom brood"

Top is mostly honey.
Bottom is mostly drones.
Added strip to the bottom. Now both boxes have a strip"

Did get stung in suit, but was probably because of a bee that was already in my suit somehow.

Gave them 2.5kg bag of Fondabee (bought at Nectarist.be) on the day of the inspection.

Probably no need to put in a new frame as the current ones still could do with more building"

Gave them 2.5kg bag of Fondabee (bought at Nectarist.be) on the 17th (couple days before the inspection). They had eaten a cilinder sized hole of about 1.5cm into it when we removed it during the inspection"

Check broodframes for actual brood capping (then add box)";;"Very calm.
A lot of brood, less honey (might be because we put the box on last time). Seems like they might be opening winter savings to expand more or something."
